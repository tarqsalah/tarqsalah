ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tarig from Sudan ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡©.
I am a researcher exploring groundwater extremes and climate change impacts. Currently, Iâ€™m delving into regional drought impact assessment using GIS and data-driven methods.

Iâ€™m passionate about learning and growing in the fields of data science, hydrology, and climate change adaptation. As part of my research, I build machine learning models for groundwater management and environmental conservation, particularly using R programming.

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to drought analysis, hydrological modelling, and the application of machine learning in environmental research.

Iâ€™m an adventurous spirit who loves nature and poetry.
I enjoy playing football, hiking, and spending time at the gym!
